# SUPERSEDED

Please use [acme.sh's built-in support for UniFi](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/deployhooks#23-deploy-the-cert-on-a-unifi-controller-or-cloud-key).

# unifi-acme.sh

The `update-unifi-certificate.sh` script enables easy updating of the certificate used by [UniFi Controller](https://www.ubnt.com/enterprise/software). [acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh) is used to obtain a certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). The script has been tested on Debian 8 "Jessie" with Unifi Controller installed via the official Debian repository and on a UniFi CloudKey on firmware version 0.7.3.

## How to use

* Install [acme.sh](https://github.com/Neilpang/acme.sh) and follow the instructions to create a certificate for the domain you want to use to access UniFi Controller.
* Set the reload command to the `update-unifi-certificate.sh` script:
  * `--reloadcmd '/path/to/update-unifi-certificate.sh "certificate.domain.here" "/path/to/certificate/directory"'`
* If acme.sh was installed in the default directory (`.acme.sh` in the user's home directory) and the certificate directory is under `.acme.sh` and is named for the domain inside of it, the second parameter can be omitted from the command:
  * `--reloadcmd '/path/to/update-unifi-certificate.sh "certificate.domain.here"'`
